Increase your website revenue using this simple AdSense Management tool.

== Description ==

To help increase AdSense revenue on your website, why not try using the free Wordpress plugin that I have just finished developing called WP AdSense Specific. As the name suggests, it is a simple AdSense Management plugin for your Wordpress website that allows you to manage specific AdSense channels dynamically throughout your website. You get the advantage of targeting specific keywords to match key areas around your site. This is especially useful for bigger sites where you could change an entire section with one single update.
